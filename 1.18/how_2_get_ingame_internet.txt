To get internet to connect from your in-game computer to your IRL computer, try one of these two OpenComputers2 forks:
https://github.com/Paranoidlabs/oc2/tree/develop
https://github.com/Ktlo/oc2/tree/internet-card

I used the second b/c I couldn't figure out how to use the first.
The OpenComputers2 mod main branch is a few commits ahead, but you can merge either fork into main and it works fine.

Guide on how to connect to the internet using the Ktlo fork:
0. Install mosh normally for your IRL computer
1. Make a computer in-game, put an internet card in.
2. Build mosh for riscv64-musl with the given script and import the mosh-client into your in-game hard-drive.
    (Found in .minecraft/saves/<world>/oc2-blobs/. The weird files are actually filesystems that can be mounted!)
    You will need an extra hard-drive separate from the one Sedna Linux is installed on, or there won't be enough space.
        Add your hard drive. It will be found in /dev/vdb. mke2fs it then mount it to use it.
4. Also import your IRL terminfo entries /usr/bin/terminfo/m/mosh* into your in-game computer's /usr/bin/terminfo/m/.
5. Run the following on your in-game computer (need to re-run every reboot, I recommend making a shell script):
    ip link set eth0 up
    ip addr add 192.168.2.1
    ip route add default via 192.168.2.2
    (explanation here: https://github.com/fnuecke/oc2/pull/63#issuecomment-1166291060)
6. Also run the following (in-game), because by default it points to the wrong place.
    export TERMINFO=/usr/lib/terminfo
7. IRL, run mosh-server. You'll see "MOSH CONNECT 60001 <secret_key>"
8. In-game, run MOSH_KEY=<secret_key> ./mosh-client <your_IRL_IP> 60001

If mosh doesn't connect, try again / use htop to make sure mosh-server didn't timeout or something / make sure you typed the key correctly.
It can take a couple tries.
